1. How do you define coaching?  
Not the player. Helps team achieve more than they thought possible without touching the content. Like a box of Nerds. One side is IQ. The knowledge around process. The other side is EQ. Observation and intervention to influence team dynamics. Coach is not involved in content, they help team with process and growth. 

Step out of the coaches box to mentor with intention. 
2. What are some common myths or misconceptions you have seen about innovation coaches?  
* A coach is a police officer. Or a helicopter parent. The goal is to build a self-contained high functioning team.
* A coach is not a judge. You should not be making decisions or solving disagreements.
*  A coach is a player. Do not work with or for the team.
3. How do you grow as a coach?  
Being a coach. Review about appearance. I learned I have to be okay with someone not accepting me as a coach. But that does not impact the value that I bring. All we walk into a room with is our experience and knowledge. Our past and present. We can't make decisions or hire and fire. You job is to help them achieve more than they thought possible not to be their friend. Be okay with being vulnerable.  

Developing coaches. Someone who wanted to spend a lot of time on preparing. Helping her be in the moment. Was trying to bring order to the room and tried to ding the bell to advance the slide. Find a thread to pull on and play with. Be comfortable with variability. Trying to find stories that are emblematic of growth or areas the coach is focusing on. Finding common threads and shared moments is a big part of building rapport. 

Connecting guy in Singapore from Brazil with someone in Amsterdam he knew from Brazil. Power of observation and building rapport led to that connection.

4. What are some roadblocks you have experienced as a coach?
Being comfortable in my own skin. Because our roles are not well defined I have to be aware of my feelings and self perception. Naturally very observant of peoples behavior. Had to read my angry stepfather. But also have a desire to appease. Had to understand these things are okay if I understand how they impact my coaching. Have to check in with myself. Questioning and congratulating myself.  
  
There is no right answer. Wanted to give great advice. Overcame that with multiple approaches to same question and providing response that is best for team.  

5. What is one piece of advice you would give to yourself if you could time travel?   
Coaching is a journey not a destination you arrive at. It is continually growing.
